# Transactive ILC Coordinator Application

This application allows ILC to participate in either real-time pricing (RTP)
markets or single-step market-based control. Further enhancements of the
TC ILC are needed to allow for its full integration with the Transactive
Network Template framework by adding the ability for the TC ILC to forecast
the building flexibility over a 24-hour horizon.

This work is under way and consists of the following:

1. Forecasting the hourly average building demand for the next 24 hours based
 on historical building data and current weather conditions.

2. Forecasting the hourly average flexibility of each controllable load for
 the next 24-hour period (i.e., an hourly average value for maximum and minimum
  consumptions for each controllable load) based on historical data and current weather conditions.

3. The methodology for accomplishing this is in progress and this feature should be
 incorporated in software tested for the June milestone.
