# Intelligent Load Control (ILC) Application

ILC supports traditional demand response as well as transactive energy
services. ILC manages controllable loads while also mitigating
service-level excursions (e.g., occupant comfort, minimizing equipment
ON/OFF cycling) by dynamically prioritizing available loads for curtailment
using both quantitative (deviation of zone conditions from set point) and
qualitative rules (type of zone).
